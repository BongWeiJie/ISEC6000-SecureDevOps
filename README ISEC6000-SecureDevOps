ISEC6000-SecureDevOps Assignment 1

This repository stores the codes and configurations for ISEC6000-SecureDevOps Assignment 1. The project focuses on developing and designing microservices-based e-commerce application called Saleor. 
Saleor is an open-source, Python-based platform that simulates real-world e-commerce solution.
It is built on microservices architecture, utilizing a backend API, a dynamic React frontend with a dashboard, a PostgreSQL database, and an in-memory Redis cache.
Google Cloud services, especially, Google Kuberbenetes CLuster (GKE) will also be deployed in this project.
Saleor Dashboard will be deployed using Docker after certain configurations have been made. 
These configurations include: changing port to 9002, making best docker practices changes and scanning images for vulnerabilities using Trivy.

Summary:
1) Fork saleor-platform and rename it to ISEC6000-SecureDevOps.
2) Create GKE clusters and make changes to config using kubectl.
3) Deploy pods and ensure the pods are running.
4) Download Saleor-Platform components into local machine.
5) Deploy Saleor Dashboard.
6) Make changes according to Docker best practices.
7) Commit changes to docker.yml and tagging it with "isec6000-assigment1" in Github.
8) Scan docker images use with Trivy.
9) Document scan results and take remedial actions.
